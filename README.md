## CloudSound

## What?

Pathetic fallacy... 

>...is a literary device referring to weather and how it affects the mood and how it can add atmosphere to a story: smiling skies, somber clouds, angry storm, or bitter winter.

We want give the user a cathartic synergy of weather and emotion through CloudSound - a mobile-first website that gives you a weather-based playlist for the location you choose.

## Why?

We believe in the power of music to put you fully in touch with your surroundings. Let us help connect you with nature.

## How?

Api requests from Soundcloud, Google Maps and the Open Weather Map are made to obtain data for CloudSound.

In this first prototype:
* The user can specify the location they want the weather for by clicking on a world map.
* Longitude and latitude coordinates are fetched from Google Maps and fed into the Open Weather Map. 
* This in turn generates a weatherResults variable which is matched to range of tags selected from Sound Cloud's api to compile your playlist.
